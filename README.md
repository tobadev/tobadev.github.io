## **whoami** ?
I'm 20 year old technology geek who is currently stuck in collapse country.
Knowledge I have is related mostly to IT, Computer Security, IT Security and Research, Ethical Hacking. That knowledge set is not excelent, or related to just one. It's acquired over the years, for example first time I had contact with any type of development it was back in 2009 (12 year old, lolwat) while I was creating my own private servers for WoW (World of WarCraft). After that I started to learn different things everyday, and I'm still learning, technology is my only goal, nothing else, no math, no chemistry, no physics...
I'm really friendly and communicative, and depends on my mood, sometimes you can't follow me, sorry about that.

##a little more
I know, you read all this and still thinkin' really boy you know all this and you didn't knew to get some real badass custom made CMS with badass template? I never mention any design skills boy, i'm really horrible at whole frontend thing. Website is still under construction and when I got time I will finish it. At some point I'll try to make blog and keep it up-to-date.
*My main goal is to finish the job, for example, if you give me job to make you dynamic website, does it really matters if it is custom made CMS, or just another WordPress or some tryhad practical PHP set of scripts? Who cares, as long I get the job done. Of course if you request custom made CMS, or specific WordPress plugins I will respect your request and do my best to make it work. As I said, the goal is to get the job done, if you don't like my logic, you shouldn't be here homie.*
